    This site allows a user to build a nonogram prototype for use in creating nonogram grids. When a user first logs on,
    they are presented with a blank 5x5 grid and and the selecting color is set to black. A user can select which color
    want to use from the color selector. The current color is displayed in the text above the color selector. For setting
    the size of the grid, the options are a preset 5x5 button, a 10x10 button, or a user may customize select the row and
    column from the range sliders. The minimum size of the row/column is 1 cell. The max size for rows is 14 cells. The
    max size for columns is 14 cells, or however many will fit on your current browser width, whichever is smaller. The
    user choose to undo or redo any of their moves for selecting a new color, coloring a tile, or changing the grid size.
    At any time, the user may save the state of their grid to a file for later use. Only one file may saved at a time,
    any new saves will overwrite the file.

    On the files page, the saved file may be downloaded to your local computer. There is also functionality for uploading
    your own files. Only .txt files are permitted to be loaded to the files page. There is a load and download button
    next to each file name on the page. If load is selected, the file will be error checked for invalid dimensions and
    colors. If any discrepancies are found, the file will not be loaded, an alert will pop up letting the user know the
    file was invalid, and the main page will display with a default white 5x5 grid. If the file is valid, the new board
    will be loaded and displayed on the main screen.
